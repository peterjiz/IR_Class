Cascading global stock prices are evoking grim memories of the great market crash of 1929, but analysts are reminding investors of safeguards in place before they stash their savings under the mattress.     But some also say that while banking, securities and social laws written during the great depression should prevent a repeat of that dismal era, more protection still might have to be considered.         And analysts caution that while new laws can deal with some problems, lawmakers can't legislate away fear--which  helped drive the New York Stock Exchange to its record 508-point Dow Jones index loss on Monday.     That 22.6 percent loss nearly doubled the Oct 29, 1929  loss of 11.7 percent. On the day before that year, the market fell nearly 13 per cent.     In a series of Reuters interviews with government, congressional and private analysts, most agreed safeguards exist to avoid a repeat of 1929 and its depression aftermath.     Charles Schultze, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers under Jimmy Carter, said in an interview that "the safeguards should be adequate to avoid a repeat of 1929 to 1933."     "The safeguards are fine," he said, "The safeguards are adequate to prevent a cascading liquidity failure. That's not the overall problem which is the dollar and trade deficits."     Schultze, now with the Brookings Institution think-tank, pointed to a weak Federal Reserve during the 1920s when "the Fed acted in the wrong way in 1929--it tightened money."         Similarly, President Reagan's budget manager, James Miller, told Reuters the safeguards in place should be adequate.     And millionaire oilman and business takeover specialist T. Boone Pickens said the present safeguards should avoid any 1929 situation.     "It is a much more sophisticated system, I don't see that a comparison is valid."     Marvin Kosters, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, thinks the present safeguards will work.         "The main thing is the understanding of the Federal Reserve of its responsibility to maintain liquidity in the economy," he said. "There is no reason why this (market fall) needs to spread into the real economy. Maybe it's better it happened at all."     Rex Hardesty of the huge labor confederation AFL-CIO said many of the present safeguards are not working, saying "only one-third of the unemployed are now receiving benefits."     He also called for an increase in the 3.35 dlr minimum wage which has not been raised since 1981.     One of the main things that appears different in 1987 than in 1929 is market psychology, analysts point out.     During those anything goes days of flappers and bathtub gin, the stock market was the road to riches that captured the savings of shoeshine boys to bank presidents. It was viewed as a highway to heaven with no turning back.     But happy days soon collapsed into a nationwide, hysterical panic with the stock market crash, wiping out paper millions and losing the life savings of many average investors as panic set in.     Brokers leaped from Wall Street skyscrapers. American banks closed for a  "holiday" in 1933 as depositors clamored to pull out their savings. The great depression followed leading into World War II.     Images of those days surfaced with the unprecedented sell off on Monday, but analysts maintained times are different.     House Banking committee specialist Jake Lewis said that bank investors should have no fears because their savings are now completely backed by the government.      Even though there have been record bank failures --145 last year, 148 this year through today--everyone received their savings--unlike the millions lost when banks collapsed 60 years ago.      Banking deposits, then uninsured, now are fully insured by the government up to 100,000 dlrs for each saver.     As the depression swept the nation, President Franklin Roosevelt steered into law sweeping banking and securities reforms to deal with many of the problems that led to the crash and hurt people afterwards.

Great Western Financial Corp said it is offering 2,513,200 common shares at a price of 20.625 dlrs per share.     The company said the shares are being offered in connection with the conversion of SunPoint Savings Bank FSB of Lake Worth Fla to stock from mutual form and its simultaneous merger into Great Western Bank, a federal savings bank owned by Great Western Financial.

The St. Lawrence Seaway, set to reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough year because of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the first strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officials said.     Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modes of transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal increase over last year's traffic levels -- and revenues -- on the 2,300 mile waterway, officials said.     In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, the seaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal, linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.     By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled through the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through the eight-lock canal.     The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrs this year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal 1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executive member of Canada's St Lawrence Seaway Authority.     The seaway moves about one-half of Canada's exported grain. Those exports of the single most important commodity carried on the waterway have been depressed by world surpluses.     The Seafarers' International Union, which represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has said it will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers' demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions.     "It's 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike," Roman Gralewicz, head of the Seafarers' Canadian branch, has said.     The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two sides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on the Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.     "We haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...a prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect," Seaway Authority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.     "These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the St Lawrence Seaway," George Miller, vice-president of the Canadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of major Canadian shipping companies, said recently.     The workers' current contract expires May 31. The association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages for the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to restructure crew dispatching.     The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs (U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and freight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985 was its worst year in two decades.     Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on the Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to last year's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls throughout the rest of the waterway.     Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks and about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.     "We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we won't see a major increase for a number of years," Hemsley said.     A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers in Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this season but the full benefits won't be felt for several years, Blair said.

Monday's stock market collapse could spell disaster for Republican hopes of retaining the White House in 1988 -- if it proves to be the start of a general economic downturn -- political experts said.     "The question is does the stock market (decline) signal an impending recession. If that is the case the Republicans will have a very difficult time winning," independent political analyst William Schneider told Reuters. "If the Democrats nominate anyone halfway credible they would win," he added.     Schneider's comments, on the heels of a 500-point decline in the bellwheter Dow Jones stock market average, reflected the old political adage that elections are almost always decided by voters' feelings about their financial well being.     "There is no doubt people always vote their pocketbook and we don't expect 1988 to be any different," says Donald Foley, the top spokesman for Missouri Representative Richard Gephardt's Democratic presidential campaign.     Foley added that the five-year old stock market rally has shown amazing resilience and "there's no telling where the market will be by the end of the week."     President Reagan said he was puzzled by the day's events, but is convinced the economy is fundamentally sound.     "I think everyone is puzzled ... because all the business indices are up. There is nothing wrong with the economy," he told reporters.     "I don't think anyone should panic because all the economic indicators are solid," he added.     But for the time being, the decline on Wall Street knocked the underpinnings from his boasts that the record bull market demonstrates the wisdom of current economic policy.     It could also deprive the Republicans of a major argument for keeping the White House in their hands when President Reagan leaves office in January 1989.     It gives a hollow ring to the words used by Vice President George Bush just a week ago when he formally entered the White House race.     "We have weathered the storm. Our economy has recovered to be the strongest in history," Bush said in reference to the recovery from the 1981-82 recession that pushed unemployment to its highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s.     "We mark next week the longest peacetime economic expansion in our nation's recorded history," Bush bragged.     At midday, even as Wall Street was being battered by a record selling panic, Reagan gave a glowing account of the economy's performance at a swearing in ceremony for his new Commerce Secretary, William Verity.     Indeed, the Labor Department reported earlier this month that unemployment among American workers had fallen to an eight-year low of 5.9 pct in September, compared to seven pct a year ago and a Post World War Two peak of 10.7 pct in December 1982.     But with interest rates climbing steadily and no improvement in the record U.S. trade deficit with the rest of the world, a number of economic experts have expressed doubts about the staying power of the current expansion.    Warnings of economic danger around the corner have been a staple of Democratic campaign speeches this year.     And Democratic party leaders here for an organizational meeting two weeks ago predicted at that time that the economy would be the determining factor in next year's election.     "The 1988 election will be decided, as most peacetime elections are, on economic issues," said Michigan party chairman Richard Weiner.     "In Ohio, people are uneasy. They want to know where the economy is going," added Ohio Democratic leader James Ruvulo.     American political history is replete with examples of voters throwing out incumbent officeholders when the economy turns sour -- most notably in 1932 when Democrat Franklin Roosevelt won a landslide triumph that ended 12 years of Republican rule and made the Democrats the nation's majority party for more than 40 years.     But political experts said that if Monday's stock decline turns out to be a temporary phenomena it will have no effect on the 1988 election.     "Times change, conditions change," Schneider said.     Quoting legendary baseball manager Casey Stengel, Schneider added, "Never make predictions, especially about the future."  Reuter

President Reagan is concerned about the record drop in stock prices but remains convinced on the basis of administration talks with financial experts that the economy remains sound, the White House said.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a written statement that Reagan "watched today with concern" the decline on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 500 points.     The statement said Reagan had directed administration officials to consult with leading financial experts, including the chairmen of the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchance Commission, and the New York Stock Exchange.     "These consultations confirm our view that the underlying economy remains sound," Fitzwater said.     The White House statement, issued about 45 minutes after the stock market closed, appeared designed to calm investors worried about U.S. economic propects.     "We are in the longest peacetime expansion in history. Employment is at the highest level ever. Manufacturing output is up. The trade deficit, when adjusted for changes in currencies, is steadily improving. And, as the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has recently stated, there is no evidence of a resurgence of inflation in the United States," Fitzwater said.         He said Reagan was keeping close watch on the markets in the United States and in countries, where waves of selling developed on Monday.     "We will continue to closely monitor these developments," Fitzwater said.     However, his three-paragraph statement gave no hint of what, if any, action Reagan might take if the stock market plunge continues.     The percentage drop of 22.6 percent on Monday was the second largest ever, exceeded only by the 24.4 percent drop on Dec. 12, 1914.         It easily eclipsed the fall of 12.8 percent on Oct. 28, 1929 which helped spark the Great Depression.     Reagan and his top advisers discussed the market crisis, which came on the same day American naval forces retaliated for last Friday's alleged Iranian missile attack on a U.S. flagged Kuwaiti tanker in the Gulf, at a White House issues luncheon.     Presidential aides told reporters after the luncheon an official statement was likely to be issued when the markets closed.  Reuter
